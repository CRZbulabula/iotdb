Under the sigmod folder, which locates at the same folder as README file, is our evaluation scripts:

+ client folder: scripts that start and stop the write client
+ datanode folder: scripts that start, stop and restart the nodes
+ evaluation folder: configuration files and scripts that deploy the IoTDB cluster
+ simulate-workload folder: write client java classes

To reproduce the evaluation, please follow the README file in the Apache IoTDB repository (https://github.com/apache/iotdb) to build and deploy IoTDB.
